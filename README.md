# Introduction

The **PION-BR1 satellite** was developed by **PION** (PION Labs Engenharia Ltda.), which is a brazilian newspace startup. The launch of the satellite will occur on January 13th, 2022, and it will make history in the Brazilian space sector! Take a look:

- The first satellite 100% developed by a Brazilian company;
- The first satellite entirely developed by a Brazilian startup;

The satellite will be launched in partnership with the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos (UFSCar), the Brazilian Satellite Olympiad (OBSAT/MCTI), the Maua Institute of Technology (IMT), the Latin American Space Challenge (LASC), the Brazilian Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation (AMSAT-BR) and the Brazilian Amateur Radio League (LABRE).
